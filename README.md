#  Ethereum Lottery Smart Contract

This is a simple **Ethereum-based Lottery smart contract** built using **Solidity**. Participants can enter the lottery by sending ETH, and a random winner is selected using `keccak256`. The contract demonstrates core concepts like payable functions, modifiers, array management, and randomness simulation on-chain.
